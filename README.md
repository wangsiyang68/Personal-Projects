 For fun and for learning

## Ban Luck.py

During CNY in 2018, I missed meeting up with my friends. One of the activities we would do during our meetups were to play card games, such as Ban Luck.
Created with Python, it took seven days and I found it a useful challenge to code something substantial for the first time, having learnt coding for 2 years then.  

## Lessons learnt
Looking back, here are some lessons learnt
1. God code is bad
  -  God code: given the choice, I would rewrite all the classes using interfaces and abstract classes in Java, with each of the classes having its own file. Since this is a strongly OOP-influenced project, Java may have been a more suitable language. 
2. Importance of planning
  - During implementation of the code, I often rewrote sections of it. This was due to a lack of proper planning of the different use cases, interactions and relationships between different functions and classes. In the future, before embarking on a substantial project, proper amount of time should be spent to design good use case diagrams.
